            A neutron star is a dense core left behind after a massive star goes supernova and explodes. Though only about 15 to 30 kilometers wide, they can have three times the mass of our Sun, making them some of the densest objects in the universe, second only to black holes. A teaspoon of neutron star material would weight 4 billion tons on Earth. There are several types of neutrons stars.

      <h2>Neutron Star Types</h2>

      <p>
        A neutron star is the incredibly dense, city-sized remnant of a massive star that has collapsed under its own gravity following a supernova explosion. When a star much larger than our Sun runs out of fuel, its core implodes with such force that protons and electrons are crushed together to form a solid ball of neutrons, creating the densest form of observable matter in the universe. To put this density in perspective, a single sugar-cube-sized piece of neutron star material would weigh approximately one billion tons—roughly the weight of a mountain. Despite having a mass up to twice that of our Sun, these stars are typically only about 12 miles (20 kilometers) in diameter. They often possess extreme magnetic fields and can rotate hundreds of times per second, emitting beams of radiation that make them appear as "pulsars" when viewed from Earth.

      <p>
        A pulsar is a highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star that acts as a "cosmic lighthouse." As it spins, it emits intense beams of electromagnetic radiation from its magnetic poles. Because the star’s magnetic poles are usually not aligned with its rotational axis, these beams sweep through space like the light from a lighthouse. We only detect a "pulse" of light when the beam points directly at Earth. These pulses are incredibly regular—often more precise than atomic clocks—and can range from once every few seconds to hundreds of times per second (known as millisecond pulsars).
